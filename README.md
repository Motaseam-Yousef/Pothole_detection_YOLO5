# Automation in Construction: Pothole Detection and Maintenance Cost Estimation

## Project Overview
Road safety is a crucial issue that is often compromised by the presence of potholes in streets. These roadway imperfections can lead to an increased risk of accidents and car collisions, among other concerns. Despite the urgency of the matter, we observed a lack of focus on automating the maintenance and management of this problem. To address this, our project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect potholes and calculate the cost of their repair.

## Solution
We utilized the YOLO V5 model, a highly efficient object detection model, to identify potholes on asphalt pavements. This model was trained and fine-tuned to detect potholes with a commendable accuracy of 76%. 

In addition to pothole detection, we developed a mechanism to calculate the weight of asphalt required for repair and the associated cost. This computational model provides valuable insights to professionals in the field, enabling them to estimate the required resources and strategize their maintenance efforts effectively.

## Result
The result of our project is a system that not only detects potholes but also facilitates efficient maintenance planning. By automating the detection process and providing a realistic estimate of the required asphalt and cost, our solution is set to revolutionize how road maintenance is approached. This would potentially mitigate the risks associated with potholes and contribute to safer and more efficient roadways.

## Future Direction
The project, in its current state, delivers promising results. However, we plan on enhancing the model's performance further and extending our system to include additional features that could contribute to smarter and more effective road maintenance strategies.
